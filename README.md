# Controller 

Not released yet

Code is all MIT. But deps are GPL3 so final product is GPL3. You know the drill.

## BaconPaul TODOs roughly

- Write this README
  - how to download and install
  - license

### UI ToDos

- Preset Manager UI
  - SubMenu Structure
- Factory Presets

- Damp/Attack needs a custom control since it is 0-63 off and then 64-127 slow to fast
- some basic code comments would be nice
- Error Handling
- TypeIns

Future:
- undo?
