# Controller 

Not released yet

Code is all MIT. But deps are GPL3 so final product is GPL3. You know the drill.


## BaconPaul TODOs roughly

### Engine / Model ToDos ===

- random patch
- Scan user presets and make a menu
- Baked in presets perhaps?

### UI ToDos

Mechanics:
- Label switches and so on
- About screen
- Damp/Attack needs a custom control since it is 0-63 off and then 64-127 slow to fast

Layout:
- Section by section clean up (list them here) and layout
  - OSC
  - Filt
  - EG
  - LFO
  - Mod
  - Settings/Voice
  - Remove Orphan section

Future:
- undo?
