# Controller 

Not released yet

Code is all MIT. But deps are GPL3 so final product is GPL3. You know the drill.


## BaconPaul TODOs roughly

- Write this README
  - how to download and install
  - license

### Engine / Model ToDos ===

- random patch
- Scan user presets and make a menu
- Baked in presets perhaps?
- send program changes? or at least ge tthose as presets?

### UI ToDos

- About screen
- Damp/Attack needs a custom control since it is 0-63 off and then 64-127 slow to fast
- some basic code comments would be nice
- When done remove control lists
- ToolTips at bottom of screen go off screen

Future:
- undo?

Notes for DANI
- Osc Level -> zero doesn't seem to mute
