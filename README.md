# Controller 

Not released yet

Code is all MIT. But deps are GPL3 so final product is GPL3. You know the drill.

## BaconPaul TODOs roughly

- Write this README
  - how to download and install
  - license

### Engine / Model ToDos ===

- send program changes? or at least get those as presets?

### UI ToDos

- Preset Manager UI
  - Save positions on item where I saved
  - Menu under thing to show presets and save/load
  - Put the save/load option on that menu also  

- Damp/Attack needs a custom control since it is 0-63 off and then 64-127 slow to fast
- some basic code comments would be nice
- Break up ElfinMainPanel a bit perhaps?
- Error Handling
- TypeIns

Future:
- undo?

Notes for DANI
- Osc Level -> zero doesn't seem to mute
